# RustAI
RustAI is an experimental implementaion of a graph based neural network with a multithreaded genetic selection.

## The goal

It's a simple workaround that i've done to start discovering neural networks, and to test out how the rust multithreading works.
It has no other ambition than to be a proof of concept of a neural network that can learn the XOR function.
